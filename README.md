This App has been developed as part of the **Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Course** for the Exercise Project **"Inventory App"**. This App allows a Store to keep track of the inventory of its Products across the listed Suppliers of Products, along with their Price and Pictures of the Product.

---

## App Compatibility

Android device running with Android OS 4.0.4 (API Level 15) or above. Best experienced on Android Nougat 7.1 and above. Designed for Phones and NOT for Tablets.

---

## Rubric followed for the Project

* App contains products and allows to configure a new product.
* The List Item shows -
	* The Product Name
	* Current Quantity of the Product
	* Price of the Product.
* Each List Item contains a Sale button that reduces the Quantity by 1. This should ensure not to display negative quantities.
* The Detail layout needs to -
	* Display the remainder of the details stored in the database.
	* Contain buttons that vary the Available Quantity of the Product.
	* Contain a button to order more from the Supplier.
	* Contain a button to delete the Product entirely.
* When there are no Products in the database, layout should display a TextView with instructions on how to populate the database.

---

### Things explored/developed in addition to the above defined Rubric

* Storing required information in a `SQLite` database.
* Designing and developing the Database Schema with relationships between Product, Supplier, Selling Price, Inventory, Images, Additional Product information and Supplier Contact Information to enable -
	* Multiple Seller registration per Product with their own Selling Price, Availability and Contact information.
	* Multiple Contacts per Seller, supporting different Contact Types like Phone and Email.
	* Multiple Product Photos.
	* Additional Attibutes that further defines the Product.
* Integrating Androidâ€™s File storage systems into the database for Images. Images are persisted by saving the Image files' Content URI in the database instead of storing the entire BLOB of the Image.
* Communicating with and managing the Database through a Content Provider.
* Communicating with the File Storage through a File Provider for saving and accessing the Images of a Product.
* Presenting information from Files and SQLite databases to users.
* Designing layouts with `TextInputLayout` and `TextInputEditText` to capture User input, validating the captured information to display the required error, and updating the database with the information.
* Creating intents to other apps such as the File Picker App for selecting images and the Image Capture App for taking pictures, using stored information.
	* Capturing Images is accomplished using `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` Intent, and processing the Image for storage is done using a custom [ImageStorageUtility](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/utils/ImageStorageUtility.java) in a Disk thread provided by [AppExecutors](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/utils/AppExecutors.java).
	* Selecting Images is accomplished using `ACTION_GET_CONTENT`/`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` Intent, based on the Android system version.
* Promoting the separation of concerns using the [MVP Architecture with Content Providers](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/deprecated-todo-mvp-contentproviders/) along with Repository pattern for Datasource that includes local files and database storage. Dependency injection is accomplished using a static [InjectorUtility](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/utils/InjectorUtility.java).
* Designing layouts using `CoordinatorLayout` and `ConstraintLayout`.
* Designing Item Views using `CardView`.
* Loading of Images using a custom Headless [Fragment](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/workers/ImageDownloaderFragment.java) through an [AsyncTaskLoader](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/workers/ImageDownloader.java) and caching recently loaded images using [BitmapImageCache](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/cache/BitmapImageCache.java) that internally uses `android.util.LruCache`.
* Live Debugging using [Stetho](https://facebook.github.io/stetho/) to see and validate the changes following any CRUD operation during the development process, in order to ensure that the operations are working as intended.
* Presenting Product Attributes information using a `TableLayout` with its data populated dynamically.

## Design Workflow

App is structured as an Inventory App that allows a Store to keep track of its Product inventory and record sales information. It allows to store every information of a Product along with its pictures and Suppliers information with their price and available to sell quantity. It also features Product procurement from Suppliers via the supplied Contact information of Suppliers recorded.

* The First step in setting up the Store is configuring the Products which is done in this Activity/Fragment.
* This can be launched by clicking on any Product shown in the Products Tab (for Editing an existing Product) or clicking on the FAB **"+"** button of the Products Tab (for configuring a New Product).
* Allows to record Product Name, SKU, Description, Category and Additional Attributes.
* SKU is limited to 10 alphanumeric characters and needs to be unique. 
	* Error message will be shown when the entered SKU already exists (Not unique). 
	* Error message will also be shown when the field is left blank.
	* This field will be disabled when the Activity is launched for **Editing** an existing Product.
* Category **"Other"** allows to define a custom Category which is persisted in the database on **"Save"** of the Product details entered.
	* If an existing Category is being defined under Category **"Other"**, that existing category will be selected automatically, thereby avoiding duplicate entry.
	* If Category **"Other"** is selected, and custom category is not defined, then an error message will be shown on **"Save"** of the Product details entered.   
* Additional Attributes are entered as a Name-Value pair. 
	* Name should remain unique. An error message will be shown if there is an entry with the same Name.
	* If there is an Additional Attribute entry with NO value entered in the Value part of the Name-Value pair, then an error message will be shown on **"Save"** of the Product details entered.
	* If there is an Additional Attribute entry with NO value entered in both parts of Name-Value pair, then that entry will be removed silently on **"Save"** of the Product details entered.
* This screen also shows the Default Image selected for the Product. Images can be added using the edit button present on it.

* Launches via the edit button placed on the default Image of the Product shown in the ProductConfig Activity/Fragment.
* Allows to add images for the Product and maintain a Gallery of Product's Images.
* Once the Images are added, one can select an Image from the list to be shown as the default Image for the Product.
* Images can be loaded either by selecting/picking them from the Gallery app of the Android System or capturing an Image through Camera.
	* URIs to the Image files of the Product are persisted in the database and NOT the BLOB of the Images.
	* Images captured through Camera are stored either in Primary Storage Area or Secondary Storage Area of the App based on their availability. Secondary Storage Area of the App will be given the preference when they are available.
	* Multiple Images can be picked from the Gallery App of the Android Sytem. When the same image(s) are being picked, an error message will be shown.
* Multiple Images from the Product can be selected for delete in this screen as it supports Contextual Action for Delete. Image files that were captured by this App will only be deleted and does NOT delete the Image files that were picked through the Gallery System App.
* One of the Images loaded for the Product should be selected as a Default Image. This will be enforced within this screen and one of the images if present (the first image in the list when none are selected) will be auto-selected as Default if the user decides to navigate back to the parent without executing/saving their selection.
* If a defaulted Image is deleted, then the first image in the list will be auto-defaulted to ensure that one image remains defaulted always.
* Images/URIs loaded for the Product in this screen will stay persisted even if the user decides to navigate back to the parent without saving.
* For a New Product entry, the Images/URIs persisted for the Product in this screen will be deleted silently in case the user decides to discard the New Product entry details.
* For an Existing Product entry, the Images/URIs persisted for the Product will be deleted when the Product is deleted in the ProductConfig Activity/Fragment.

* Supplier Contacts are Phone Contacts and/or Email Contacts. Contact details are required for Product procurement process.
	* If a Contact entry has been added and the Contact value is not present, then the entry will be removed silently on **"Save"** of the Supplier details entered.
	* If a Contact value has been defined more than once, then an error message will be shown when the user has navigated away from the entry or on **"Save"** of the Supplier details entered.
	* If the input Contact value is invalid, then an error message will be shown when the user has navigated away from the entry or on **"Save"** of the Supplier details entered.
	* There should be atleast one contact for a Supplier and needs to be defaulted. If there is no contact entered for a Supplier, then an error message will be shown on **"Save"** of the Supplier details entered.
	* Any first Contact entry, will be auto-defaulted. In case a defaulted Contact is removed, then the first one in the list (Phone Contacts or Emails) will be auto-defaulted to ensure that one contact remains defaulted always.
* Supplier's Products are added by picking the Products to sell via the SupplierProductPicker Activity/Fragment.
	* Once the Products are picked, user can input the Selling Price for each of the Products.
	* There is no validation on the Selling Price. User can input the value or leave it blank. If left blank, the value will be defaulted to **"0.0"**.
	* Products that are already picked will not appear for picking again in the SupplierProductPicker Activity/Fragment. This avoids duplications.
	* When a registered Product is swiped/removed from the list, the Supplier-Product link will be removed along with their Selling Price and availability if any. The Product entry will NOT be deleted.

## App Architecture

### Implementation Architecture

<img src="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/images/mvp-contentproviders.png" alt="Illustrates the introduction of a content provider in this version of the app."/>

* App follows the MVP pattern as described in the Google Samples for [MVP with Content Providers](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/deprecated-todo-mvp-contentproviders/). 
* Activities and DialogFragments that do not need any access to Repository are excluded from the MVP architecture.
	* [MainActivity](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/ui/MainActivity.java) needs to manage the basic ViewPager and its adapter fragments.
	* [AboutActivity](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/ui/about/AboutActivity.java) is just a plain Activity and has no specific function.
	* [ProgressDialogFragment](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/ui/common/ProgressDialogFragment.java) and [ProductImagePickerDialogFragment](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/ui/products/image/ProductImagePickerDialogFragment.java) do not need access to Repository or have any major functions that needs to be carried out in a Presenter.
* Access to the Repository is governed by the [StoreRepository](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/data/StoreRepository.java) which interfaces with two other repositories - 
	1. **Local Database Storage** - [StoreLocalRepository](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/data/local/StoreLocalRepository.java)
		* For the Database management that stores and manages the Products, Suppliers and their Sales information.
	2. **Local File Storage** - [StoreFileRepository](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/data/local/StoreFileRepository.java)
		* For the Products' Images storage and their management.

### Database Schema

* The Store Database is made up of the following tables that have relationship with each other as shown in the above Schema - 
	* **"item"** Table.
		* Stores the Product information.
	* **"item_category"** Table.
		* Stores a list of Categories that can used to categorize a Product.
	* **"item_image"** Table.
		* Stores the Images of a Product.
	* **"item_attr"** Table.
		* Stores the Additional Attributes information of a Product.
	* **"supplier"** Table.
		* Stores the Supplier information.
	* **"contact_type"** Table.
		* Stores the different Contact types of a Supplier Contact information.
	* **"supplier_contact"** Table.
		* Stores the contact information of a Supplier.
	* **"item_supplier_info"** Table.
		* Stores the Supplier's listed Price for a Product.
	* **"item_supplier_inventory"** Table.
		* Stores the Supplier's available to sell quantity for a Product.
		
* The Queries executed for retrieving the required information in each Fragment/Activity are provided by the Utility class [QueryArgsUtility](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/storeapp/data/local/utils/QueryArgsUtility.java). Each of the queries executed are documented in this class.
* For more information on the Database Schema, read the [Store Database Schema Wiki](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/StoreApp/wiki/Database-Setup).
